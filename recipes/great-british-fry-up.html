      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is the version I make most weekends, especially if there are guests or I've over-indulged with drinks the night before. You can leave out anything you don't have and can include other ingredients such as, black pudding, baked beans (the Heinz UK version) or even scrambled eggs.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 link pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 frozen hash brown patty</li>
        <li>2 thick slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 tomato, cut in half</li>
        <li>4 mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 slice white bread</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and hash brown. Fry until browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn them over to fry on the other side and add the tomato, bacon and mushrooms. The idea is to start cooking with the things that take the longest.</li>
        <li>When the tomato, bacon and mushrooms are just about cooked, crack the egg into the center and allow to cook. You might want to add a little more oil just to crisp the edges. Toast the slice of bread while the egg cooks and then spread butter on it. Serve everything on a plate with the toast on the side.</li>
      </ol>
